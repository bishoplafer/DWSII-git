              <p>Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ is available in Clear, Cedar, Redwood, Hickory, Chestnut, and the new Cobblestone Gray. Like all Hemp Shield products, Log Home Treatment™ is made with 100% pure hemp oil, non-formaldehyde fungicide, algaecide, and mildewcide, and the finest trans-oxide pigments.</p>
              <p>Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ is non-toxic, emits no hazardous air pollutants (HAP's), and produces very few fumes. "Clear" Log Home Treatment™ contains 9g/l volatile organic compounds (VOC's) and colored versions contain 48g/l or less VOC's. Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ is suitable for interior or exterior use on all wood species used in log home construction.</p>
              <p>Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ has out-lasted other national brands in Accelerated Aging Chamber testing, and almost completely blocks tannin bleed-through on cedar. A penetrating oil compound, Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ can also help prevent and minimize cracking in logs.</p>
              <p>Hemp Shield Log Home Treatment™ is available from the Online Store, with free shipping on orders of two or more gallons.</p>

			  <h5>Eco-Friendly Hemp Shield Tops Cedar Tannin Bleed Test</h5>
        <img class="th" src="img/Tanin Test Display.png"/>
        <p>Tannin is a dark brown, acrid oil found in many trees, including oak and cedar. In outdoor use, tannin will become concentrated, staining and darkening the wood’s surface, especially following the grain.</p>

      <h4>New ASTM Test Results Show Hemp Shield's All-Around Performance Superior To Nationwide Competitors:</h4>
      <img class="left" src="img/HS_Comparisons_450@72.png"/>
      <h5>"You  can't judge a book by its cover..."</h5>
      <p>That old saying applies to wood protectants as well as literature. A product's label may contain performance claims, but important — and often overlooked — factors determining long term performance of an outdoor wood protectant such as resistance  to ultra-violet (UV) light, adhesion, coverage, volatile organic compound (VOC) content, and microbial resistance, can only be determined by testing.</p>
      <p>Recently a major national home improvement chain asked for tests of Hemp Shield Wood Finish and Deck Sealer against wood protectant brands that they currently sell. The photos and accompanying test results and analysis demonstrate that Hemp Shield out-performs its nationally marketed competitors in American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) tests.</p>
